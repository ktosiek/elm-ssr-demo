# Elm SSR Experiments

Experiment in building an SSR app in Elm.

The server is heavily inspired by [spades](https://github.com/rogeriochaves/spades), but adds some new stuff (basically most of the TODO :-))

TODO:
* [x] Render a simple view
* [ ] Keep focus after rehydration
* [ ] Keep inputs state after rehydration
* [ ] Rehydrate the state from the server
* [x] Download data on the server / wait for a stable state
